## Description

The PerQoDA software is designed to test the quality of a dataset using permutation testing.

We used the Weles tool published at https://github.com/w4k2/weles. Data shuffling requires a slight modification of the original code by adding a protocol that supports shuffling methods. Contact us if you need help.
